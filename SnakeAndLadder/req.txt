Here is my implementation for Simulating Snake and Ladder game.

1- Multi Player game. Played on a grid of size 100. Each cell will have a number.
2 -Some off the cell will have ladder which will jump to higher number.
3 -Some cell will have a snake which will take you down to tail number.
4- Player will in turn roll a die(1-6). Based on the value user will advance.
